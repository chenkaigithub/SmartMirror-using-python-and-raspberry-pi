The gmail api might now work because it requires an api key from google developer consle. Because of the gmail api, the app might now work as it will keep on making a request to gmail server, as a result it will keep on loading. A local host server is also needed to make http request to gmail.

Prerequisite
1) Gmail api key
2) Python or Node.js local web server

There are few things that needed to be done before running the app.

I will upload a short video shortly to demonstrate how to run it.

For any issues, do contact me.
