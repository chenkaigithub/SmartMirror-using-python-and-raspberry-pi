# SmartMirror using Python and Raspberry Pi


# Description
This project has been developed within the context of a time where every day we see more and more connected devices. The Internet transformed our lives by connecting us more easily to information and other people in the virtual world. Mobile phones then became smartphones and since then this concept has erupted and morphed into the Internet of Things, things which connect us to everyday objects. There are no end of objects that could be made “smarter”, some being more suited to this than others. Mirrors, for example, provide a large surface ideal for displaying information and interacting with. Most people have mirrors at home so the concept of a smart mirror that you can interact with is attractive and has been fantasized in many futuristic movies.

# Internet of Things
The Internet of Things is a concept defined as a network of connected physical objects (Internet of things, 2016). It’s often viewed as the next step for the internet. Recently it has gained a lot of popularity predicting that in the future most everyday objects will be connected to each other and will be able to interact in smart ways. The Smart Mirror will eventually become one of these connected objects in our households and if we think about it being able to communicate with other objects the possibilities become endless.
